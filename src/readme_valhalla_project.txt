code license which is included under the file "readme_sauerbraten.txt" for

LICENSE NOTES
=============
The license covers the source code found in the "src" directory of this
archive as well as the .cfg files under the "data" directory. The included 
ENet network library which Tesseract uses is covered by an MIT-style 
license, which is however compatible with the above license for all 
practical purposes.

Other media included with this distribution (maps, textures, sounds, models etc.)
are NOT covered by this license, and may have individual copyrights and
distribution restrictions (see individual readmes).
