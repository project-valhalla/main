Installation:

1) Locate your custom Tesseract folder:
    1a) Linux:    /home/username/.tesseract/
    1b) Windows:  C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\tesseract
// It can be little different depending on OS version...
// I'm not familiar with MacOS, and to be quite honest, I don't want to be :d
2) Extract content of downloaded .zip file into Tesseract folder mentioned above.
// If asked to Merge and Replace, click "Yes"

About Map:

 - Inspired by Quake I and Lovecraft's stories. Quake I rocks!
 - Main idea of this map is minimalism. Abstract structure in middle of desert...
 - Sauerbraten version of this map has more movement options, but Tesseract version has more stable one.
 - Try not to stay on open ground jumping too long... Bots and players love it!

License:

I hate this part, but oh well... All content shared in 'azag.zip' is created by me, Suiseiseki, using Tesseract Game Engine. Use it however you want, make good stuff how ever you want, share good stuff how ever you want... I couldn't care less if you credit me or not, and I would be more than happy if someone made CTF or some other gamemode version of this map. If you insist on some license, use MIT, but I really dislike how licenses limit (and in some cases hurt) creativity. Respecting other people's work is more than obeying 1 paper or file and crediting them.
