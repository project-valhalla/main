Made by me, driven by you?

Author : Kevin 'Rorshach' Johnstone (rorshach@polycount.com)
webs : www.polycount.com/cottages/rorshach

These were originally made for the Headhunters 3 TC.
They got lost, they got broke, then they were found !
They are in raw format so you can do as you wish with them
in terms of converting them to other engines.

I'd prefer you didnt edit them and request you do credit me
for the use of them as they took some time to make.

Cheers,
r.

 - Only changes that were made was renaming textures to #.jpg for easier use.
 - Just to keep things clear, all credit goes to Rorschach and Mayhem.

You can find 'texset.c' and 'tex.c' in my folder.
